### Red, White, and Royal Blue
A film adaptation of my favorite book of the same title, the story follows the elusive son of the President of the United States, **Alex Claremont-Diaz**, and his rivalry-turned relationship with the dashing Prince of Wales, **His Royal Highness Prince Henry George Edward James Fox-Mountchristen-Windsor**.
The film was released on August 2023, on PrimeVideo. 
**Alex Claremont-Diaz** was portrayed by *Taylor Zhakar-Perez*. 
**Prince Henry George Edward James Fox-Mountchristen-Windsor** was portrayed by *Nicholas Galitzine*. However, in the film, his last name was **Hanover-Stuart-Fox**.
